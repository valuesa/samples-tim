 * 4 You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

     You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

     Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
     Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

 * 5 Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

     You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 *   Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

     Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
     return [0, 1].
